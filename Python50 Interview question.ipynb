    "1. What is the difference between a list and a tuple?\n",
    "I’ve been asked this question in every python / data science interview I’ve ever had. Know the answer like the back of your hand.\n",
    "Lists are mutable. They can be modified after creation.\n",
    "Tuples are immutable. Once a tuple is created it cannot by changed\n",
    "Lists have order. They are an ordered sequences, typically of the same type of object. Ie: all user names ordered by creation date, [\"Seth\", \"Ema\", \"Eli\"]\n",
    "Tuples have structure. Different data types may exist at each index. Ie: a database record in memory, (2, \"Ema\", \"2020–04–16\") # id, name, created_at\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How is string interpolation performed?\n",
    "Without importing the Template class, there are 3 ways to interpolate strings.\n",
    "name = 'Chris'\n",
    "# 1. f strings\n",
    "print(f'Hello {name}')\n",
    "# 2. % operator\n",
    "print('Hey %s %s' % (name, name))\n",
    "# 3. format\n",
    "print(\n",
    " \"My name is {}\".format((name))\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the difference between “is” and “==”?\n",
    "Early in my python career I assumed these were the same… hello bugs. So for the record, is checks identity and == checks equality.\n",
    "We’ll walk through an example. Create some lists and assign them to names. Note that b points to the same object as a in below.\n",
    "a = [1,2,3]\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "c = [1,2,3]\n",
    "Check equality and note they are all equal.\n",
    "print(a == b)\n",
    "print(a == c)\n",
    "#=> True\n",
    "#=> True\n",
    "But do they have the same identity? Nope.\n",
    "print(a is b)\n",
    "print(a is c)\n",
    "#=> True\n",
    "#=> False\n",
    "We can verify this by printing their object id’s.\n",
    "print(id(a))\n",
    "print(id(b))\n",
    "print(id(c))\n",
    "#=> 4369567560\n",
    "#=> 4369567560\n",
    "#=> 4369567624\n",
    "c has a different id than a and b.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a decorator?\n",
    "Another questions I’ve been asked in every interview. It’s deserves a post itself, but you’re prepared if you can walk through writing your own example.\n",
    "A decorator allows adding functionality to an existing function by passing that existing function to a decorator, which executes the existing function as well as additional code.\n",
    "We’ll write a decorator that that logs when another function is called.\n",
    "Write the decorator function. This takes a function, func, as an argument. It also defines a function, log_function_called, which calls func() and executes some code, print(f'{func} called.'). Then it return the function it defined\n",
    "def logging(func):\n",
    "  def log_function_called():\n",
    "    print(f'{func} called.')\n",
    "    func()\n",
    "  return log_function_called\n",
    "Let’s write other functions that we’ll eventually add the decorator to (but not yet).\n",
    "def my_name():\n",
    "  print('chris')\n",
    "def friends_name():\n",
    "  print('naruto')\n",
    "my_name()\n",
    "friends_name()\n",
    "#=> chris\n",
    "#=> naruto\n",
    "Now add the decorator to both.\n",
    "@logging\n",
    "def my_name():\n",
    " print('chris')\n",
    "@logging\n",
    "def friends_name():\n",
    " print('naruto')\n",
    "my_name()\n",
    "friends_name()\n",
    "#=> <function my_name at 0x10fca5a60> called.\n",
    "#=> chris\n",
    "#=> <function friends_name at 0x10fca5f28> called.\n",
    "#=> naruto\n",
    "See how we can now easily add logging to any function we write just by adding @logging above it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain the range function\n",
    "Range generates a list of integers and there are 3 ways to use it.\n",
    "The function takes 1 to 3 arguments. Note I’ve wrapped each usage in list comprehension so we can see the values generated.\n",
    "range(stop) : generate integers from 0 to the “stop” integer.\n",
    "[i for i in range(10)]\n",
    "#=> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "range(start, stop) : generate integers from the “start” to the “stop” integer.\n",
    "[i for i in range(2,10)]\n",
    "#=> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "range(start, stop, step) : generate integers from “start” to “stop” at intervals of “step”.\n",
    "[i for i in range(2,10,2)]\n",
    "#=> [2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    "Thanks \n",
    "Searge Boremchuq\n",
    " for suggesting a more pythonic way to do this!\n",

    "6. Define a class named car with 2 attributes, “color” and “speed”. Then create an instance and return speed.\n",
    "class Car :\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, speed):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.speed = speed\n",

    "car.speed\n",
    "#=> '100mph'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the difference between instance, static and class methods in python?\n",
    "Instance methods : accept self parameter and relate to a specific instance of the class.\n",
    "Static methods : use @staticmethod decorator, are not related to a specific instance, and are self-contained (don’t modify class or instance attributes)\n",
    "Class methods : accept cls parameter and can modify the class itself\n",
    "We’re going to illustrate the difference around a fictional CoffeeShop class.\n",
    "class CoffeeShop:\n",
    "    specialty = 'espresso'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, coffee_price):\n",
    "        self.coffee_price = coffee_price\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # instance method\n",
    "    def make_coffee(self):\n",
    "        print(f'Making {self.specialty} for ${self.coffee_price}')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # static method    \n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def check_weather():\n",
    "        print('Its sunny')\n",
    "    # class method\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def change_specialty(cls, specialty):\n",
    "        cls.specialty = specialty\n",
    "        print(f'Specialty changed to {specialty}')\n",
    "CoffeeShop class has an attribute, specialty, set to 'espresso' by default. Each instance of CoffeeShop is initialized with an attribute coffee_price . It also has 3 methods, an instance method, a static method and a class method.\n",
    "Let’s initialize an instance of the coffee shop with a coffee_price of 5. Then call the instance method make_coffee.\n",
    "coffee_shop = CoffeeShop('5')\n",
    "coffee_shop.make_coffee()\n",
    "#=> Making espresso for $5\n",
    "Now call the static method. Static methods can’t modify class or instance state so they’re normally used for utility functions, for example, adding 2 numbers. We used ours to check the weather.Its sunny. Great!\n",
    "coffee_shop.check_weather()\n",
    "#=> Its sunny\n",
    "Now let’s use the class method to modify the coffee shop’s specialty and then make_coffee.\n",
    "coffee_shop.change_specialty('drip coffee')\n",
    "#=> Specialty changed to drip coffee\n",
    "coffee_shop.make_coffee()\n",
    "#=> Making drip coffee for $5\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how make_coffee used to make espresso but now makes drip coffee!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the difference between “func” and “func()”?\n",
    "The purpose of this question is to see if you understand that all functions are also objects in python.\n",
    "def func():\n",
    "    print('Im a function')\n",
    "    \n",
    "func\n",
    "#=> function __main__.func>\n",
    "func()    \n",
    "#=> Im a function\n",
    "func is the object representing the function which can be assigned to a variable or passed to another function. func() with parentheses calls the function and returns what it outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Explain how the map function works\n",
    "map returns a map object (an iterator) which can iterate over returned values from applying a function to every element in a sequence. The map object can also be converted to a list if required.\n",
    "def add_three(x):\n",
    "    return x + 3\n",
    "li = [1,2,3]\n",
    "[i for i in map(add_three, li)]\n",
    "#=> [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "Above, I added 3 to every element in the list.\n",
    "A reader suggested a more pythonic implementation. Thanks \n",
    "Chrisjan Wust\n",
    "!\n",
    "def add_three(x):\n",
    "    return x + 3\n",

    " \n",
    "10. Explain how the reduce function works\n",
    "This can be tricky to wrap your head around until you use it a few times.\n",
    "reduce takes a function and a sequence and iterates over that sequence. On each iteration, both the current element and output from the previous element are passed to the function. In the end, a single value is returned.\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "def add_three(x,y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "li = [1,2,3,5]\n",

    "#=> 11\n",
    "11 is returned which is the sum of 1+2+3+5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Explain how the filter function works\n",
    "Filter literally does what the name says. It filters elements in a sequence.\n",
    "Each element is passed to a function which is returned in the outputted sequence if the function returns True and discarded if the function returns False.\n",
    "def add_three(x):\n",
    "    if x % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        return True        \n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "li = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\n",
    "[i for i in filter(add_three, li)]\n",
    "#=> [2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    "Note how all elements not divisible by 2 have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Does python call by reference or call by value?\n",
    "Be prepared to go down a rabbit hole of semantics if you google this question and read the top few pages.\n",
    "In a nutshell, all names call by reference, but some memory locations hold objects while others hold pointers to yet other memory locations.\n",
    "name = 'object'\n",
    "Let’s see how this works with strings. We’ll instantiate a name and object, point other names to it. Then delete the first name.\n",
    "x = 'some text'\n",
    "y = x\n",
    "x is y #=> True\n",
    "del x # this deletes the 'a' name but does nothing to the object in memory\n",
    "z = y\n",
    "y is z #=> True\n",
    "What we see is that all these names point to the same object in memory, which wasn’t affected by del x.\n",
    "Here’s another interesting example with a function.\n",
    "name = 'text'\n",
    "def add_chars(str1):\n",
    "    print( id(str1) ) #=> 4353702856\n",

    "    \n",
    "add_chars(name)\n",
    "print(name) #=>text\n",
    "Notice how adding an s to the string inside the function created a new name AND a new object. Even though the new name has the same “name” as the existing name.\n",

    "13. How to reverse a list?\n",
    "Note how reverse() is called on the list and mutates it. It doesn’t return the mutated list itself.\n",
    "li = ['a','b','c']\n",
    "print(li)\n",
    "li.reverse()\n",
    "print(li)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What does “self” refer to in a class?\n",
    "Self refers to the instance of the class itself. It’s how we give methods access to and the ability to update the object they belong to.\n",
    "Below, passing self to __init__() gives us the ability to set the color of an instance on initialization.\n",
    "class Shirt:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",

    "Adding 2 lists together concatenates them. Note that arrays do not function the same way.\n",
    "a = [1,2]\n",
    "b = [3,4,5]\n",
    "a + b\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is the difference between a shallow and a deep copy?\n",
    "We’ll discuss this in the context of a mutable object, a list. For immutable objects, shallow vs deep isn’t as relevant.\n",
    "We’ll walk through 3 scenarios.\n",
    "i) Reference the original object. This points a new name, li2, to the same place in memory to which li1 points. So any change we make to li1 also occurs to li2.\n",

    "li2 = li1\n",
    "li1.append(['d'])\n",
    "print(li2)\n",
    "#=> [['a'], ['b'], ['c'], ['d']]\n",
    "ii) Create a shallow copy of the original. We can do this with the list() constructor, or the more pythonic mylist.copy() (thanks \n",
    "Chrisjan Wust\n",
    " !).\n",
    "A shallow copy creates a new object, but fills it with references to the original. So adding a new object to the original collection, li3, doesn’t propagate to li4, but modifying one of the objects in li3 will propagate to li4.\n",
    "li3 = [['a'],['b'],['c']]\n",

    "print(li4)\n",
    "#=> [[['X']], ['b'], ['c']]\n",
    "iii) Create a deep copy. This is done with copy.deepcopy(). The 2 objects are now completely independent and changes to either have no affect on the other.\n",

    "Note: Python’s standard library has an array object but here I’m specifically referring to the commonly used Numpy array.\n",
    "Lists exist in python’s standard library. Arrays are defined by Numpy.\n",
    "Lists can be populated with different types of data at each index. Arrays require homogeneous elements.\n",
    "Arithmetic on lists adds or removes elements from the list. Arithmetic on arrays functions per linear algebra.\n",

    "21. What do you like about Python?\n",
    "Note this is a very subjective question and you’ll want to modify your response based on what the role is looking for.\n",
    "Python is very readable and there is a pythonic way to do just about everything, meaning a preferred way which is clear and concise.\n",
